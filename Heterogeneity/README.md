# Heterogeneity

This directory contains the scripts for heterogeneity testing. This calculates a sequence of heterogeneity scores for the simulated expression values. This is based on the expressions of the first subphenotype and custom specified pi value

To obtain such a sequence, run

```
python3 heterogeneity_expression.py [pi] [data_path] [result_path]
```
